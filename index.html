        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have spent 30 years in web development, ecommerce and Dynamic Content Management as my 2nd Career.  My first was in finance (my degrees majored in Finance and accounting), analysing and trading FX futures, in a role that would now be considered a ‘Quant’.   I started building my first website in 1994 (at the very beginning of the public web), commercialising my skills in 1995, starting to build websites for others.  I saw the opportunity to join up web pages (as a presentation layer), with data sources like pricing tables for flights and transactional platforms such as airline reservation systems to build out new online business solutions - Online travel agency or retailers selling products, much in the same way I used to be able to currencies on my Fixed Line trading platform previously.  Rather than building my own tech, I looked into what was available, and that led me to Intershop, Europe’s leading ecommerce platform at the time.  I joined the business in 1997, as THE technical resource for the UK.  This mostly focused on Solution Consulting, but in the rapid growth of the Dotcom boom, I grew my team to 50, looking after Pre-sales, Professional Services, Training, Customer Support and IT.  I continued being the pre-sales lead for the strategic opportunities in the UK until I left in 2001, spending a few years doing the same sort of role for an eGovernment platform.  In 2005, I joined Scene7, as the first hire outside the US, to support the VP Sales expand into the EMEA region. I performed mostly as a very commercial pre-sales leader for the business, even after the acquisition by Adobe, leading to being the Pre-sales person for the top global sales person in 2008 achieving 650% of quota.  This prompted my move to a Sales role in 2009.  After significant success, I wanted to ensure that a lot of that was due to my capabilities, not just the Adobe name.  In 2012, I joined a tiny start up, with minimal license revenue and helped to transform that business, contributing to over 100x increase in recurring revenue over 12 years.  I put down my sales success to listening and understanding customer needs, being empathetic and constructing solutions that will deliver value to them.  I enjoy and value the experience of learning about businesses and how to make them more effective and efficient.  There is always so much to learn!/p>
